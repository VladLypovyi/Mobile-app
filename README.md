## Execution
We don't need to worry about the persistence's process (saving and retrieving data) because this application uses the online database "**mLab**". 

To execute the application, just enter "**ionic serve -l**" then the default web browser of the computer will show up the home page. We could choose the platform  (**Android**, **iOS**) we want to use the application.
